# PGDevOpsTips Site

A Blazor Web Assembly app written in dotnet core 6.0 that can be used to create a personal web app that integrates content managed within a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/petergregg/Content).

My own personal app is published at [pgdevopstips.co.uk](https://www.pgdevopstips.co.uk) which is deployed from this code base.

This project was inspired my Martin Kearn [blog and backend](https://github.com/martinkearn/MartinK-Me/) project.
